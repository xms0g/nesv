# nesv
**nesv** is a toy RISC-V emulator that runs entirely on the **Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)**, demonstrates that a modern 32-bit ISA can be emulated on 8-bit retro hardware.

## Features

- Emulates the **RISC-V RV32I base instruction set**  
- Branch, load/store, and arithmetic/logical instructions implemented  
- Runs on a stock NES / emulator with a standard `.nes` ROM  
- Debug output shown on NES screen (registers and PC dumps)  
- Simple test programs in RISC-V machine code can be loaded and executed  

## Limitations

- Only `RV32I` integer instructions (no compressed, no floating point, no atomics)  
- Performance is limited by the 6502 CPU speed (1.79 MHz)  
- Instruction decoder and ALU are minimal, just enough to run demos  
- No support for interrupts, traps, or a full RISC-V environment  

## Building
To build and run, youâ€™ll need the following tools:

- [`cc65`](https://cc65.github.io/)  cross development package
- `NES` emulator (e.g., FCEUX)
